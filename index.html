            <h2>Modifying fonts</h2>
            <p>One of the standout moments from Manoah's season came following a Blue Jays' 
                loss to the Baltimore Orioles in early September. It was an emotional series 
                and an emotional game that saw tempers flare between the clubs. 
                While the Orioles celebrated their triumph on the field on the Tuesday night, 
                Manoah sat in the visitors' dugout and watched. As his own teammates filed 
                into the clubhouse, he didn't move from his spot. He nodded to himself, his 
                face remained stoic. Manoah was due to take the mound the next day and it was 
                as if he was psyching himself up. That certainly worked as he proceeded to 
                turn in one of his best outings of the season, tossing eight innings of 
                three-hit, one-run ball to take the W. The situation reminds Stripling of 
                what he learned about Michael Jordan by watching the documentary miniseries 
                The Last Dance. “Manoah was pissed about the loss," says Stripling. “The next 
                day, he goes eight innings. He kind of has like that Jordan quality to him. 
                If you watch the doc, [Jordan] almost makes up that these young players were 
                talking smack about him and uses that for motivation. I feel Like Manoah has 
                that kind of edge to him where he can psych himself up for big situations and 
                then go perform better because of it."</p>

            <h2>Installed Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                For installed fonts, all you need to do is specify the <code>font-family</code>,
                for example <code>font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                This text is using a font installed on the user's computer!

            <h2>Remotely Hosted Custom Fonts (@font-face)</h2>
            <p>
                To use remotely hosted fonts, provide the <code>@font-face</code> with a
                <code>src</code> containing a url to where the font is hosted. For example,
                <code>
                    url('https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/pacifico/v16/FwZY7-Qmy14u9lezJ-6H6MmBp0u-.woff2')
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Or, you can use the stylesheet provided by the remote host. For example,
                <code>
                    &lt;link rel="stylesheet"
                    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Pacifico&display=swap" /&gt;
                </code>
            </p>

            <h2>Locally Hosted Custom Fonts (@font-face)</h2>
            
            <p>To use @font-face, you need to specify at least the following two properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>font-family</strong>: the name that will be used as the font-face
                    value for font properties
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>src</strong>: resource(s) containing the font data; can be single or
                    a comma-separated list of URLs or names of fonts on the user's computer
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                To use locally hosted fonts, provide the <code>@font-face</code> with a
                <code>src</code> containing the path to where the font is stored. For example,
                <code>url('../fonts/Calistoga/Calistoga-Regular.ttf')</code>
            </p>
            <p>
                Optionally, you can specify the format of the <code>src</code> definition by
                ending it with <code> format('[FORMAT]')</code>
            </p>
            <p>Remember to include woff2, woff, and ttf formats for your @font-face rules!</p>
